  - "It took a long time. The world was so big, and overwhelming\u2026"
  - But we finally got underneath the next machine over. The one just like ours.
  - There was a loose piece at the bottom we could pry open.
  - "With the power of the claws, we could get inside\u2026!"
  - It was pitch black inside the machine.
  - But we had to get in. We had to climb to the top and free everyone inside.
  - "Nothing to do but take a leap of faith into the darkness\u2026 "
