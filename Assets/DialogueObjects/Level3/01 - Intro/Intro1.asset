  - Axy was really quiet as we made our way across to the next machine.
  - We were getting pretty good at getting around with the claws, so we didn't need
    to talk so much.
  - And it's not like I needed Axy nattering at me anyways.
  - When we got to the base of the machine, there were two loose panels we could
    pry off.
